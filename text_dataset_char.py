        Each target sequence is the same as the input sequence, except they are shifted by 1 char to codify the target
        prediction for a char should be the next char in the review.

        The last `seq_overlap` chars in the previous sequence should be the 1st `seq_overlap` chars in the NEXT seq.
        Chars should only "spill over" from one sequence from another WITHIN THE SAME REVIEW ONLY, not ACROSS REVIEWS.

        Example (without start/end tokens): 2 review corpus = ['abcdef', '123456'], seq_len=4, seq_overlap=2

        seqs_x: [['abcd'], ['cdef'],     ['1234'], ['3456']]
        seqs_y: [['bcde'], ['def<PAD>'], ['2345'], ['456<PAD>']]

        In reality, we also insert <START> and <END> tokens around each review.
        Example (with start/end tokens): 2 review corpus = ['abcdefg', '1234'], seq_len=4, seq_overlap=2

        seqs_x: [['<START>abc'], ['bcde'], ['defg'],     ['fg<END><PAD>'],     ['<START>123'], ['234<END>']]
        seqs_y: [['abcd'],       ['cdef'], ['efg<END>'], ['g<END><PAD><PAD>'], ['1234'],       ['34<END><PAD>']]

        Parameters:
        -----------
        corpus: Python list of str.
            Each review represented by a single str.
        seq_len: int.
            The number of chars (T) in each input and target sequence.
        seq_overlap: int.
            The number of chars from the end of the prev sequence within a review that bleeds over to the start of the
            next review.

        Returns:
        --------
        Python list of str. len=N. Str coded input sequences.
            Each sequence length `seq_len`.
        Python list of str. len=N. Str coded target sequences.
            Each sequence length `seq_len`.


        NOTE:
        1. I suggest using string rather than list operations to process each review. You will be processing a lot of
        text, so keeping efficiency in mind is important (str operations can be much faster list operations).
        2. While you may use NumPy/TensorFlow, using core Python operations is enough for a fast and effective
        implementation.
        3. Don't forget to count the start and end tokens as chars that should belong to each review.
        4. Don't forget to pad by whatever amount that is necessary to make every sequence, even at the end of reviews,
        exactly `seq_len` chars long.
